technologiesânatural language processing (NLP), cognitive, machine learning, and analytics. The platform

comprises three layers: a data engagement platform that can easily access and manage multiple structured and

unstructured data sources; an âintent assessment and reasoningâ engine that includes sentiment and predictive

analytics; and a deep machine learning engine that can sense, act, and learn over time. The project entailed

automating responses to user queries at the earliest. The Monster Bot using the power of Deep Machine Learning,

NLP to handle such queries. User can see the how their queries can be answered quickly like allL1 activities can be

eliminated.

Entity Extractor -> This involves text extraction and NLP for fetching out important information from the text like

dates, names, places, contact numbers etc. This involves Regex, Bluemix NLU apiâs and machine learning using

Tensor flow for further learning of new entities.

Classifier ->This involves the classifications of classes, training of dataset and predicting the output using the SKLearn

classifier (MNB, SVM, SGD as Classifier) and SGD for the optimization to map the user queries with the best

suited response and make the system efficient.

If you are comfortable with teaching, you may be called upon to aid the more junior members of the team in any relevant area.
Other duties include following team policies (given through team orientation as upon acceptance to the team) as well as attending meetings through Slack (our instant message program that we use to communicate).

Applied AI Research Engineer
Compensation:
$250,000$350,000 USD
Location:
San Francisco, Hybrid (2 days/week onsite)
Who Are We?
We're a fast-moving AI infrastructure company partnering with frontier labs and top-tier research organizations to deliver the high-quality, domain-specific training data that cutting-edge models depend on. Our platform and services are critical for teams working on advanced AI systems from LLMs to multimodal model and our mission is to push the frontier of what's possible with human-in-the-loop AI development.
Were not here to follow trends were here to set them. Think of us as the silent engine behind your favorite frontier AI breakthroughs. You may not know our name, but you've definitely seen our fingerprints on today's most advanced models.
What's In It for You?
Real Impact, Real Fast:
You'll be dropped straight into a jungle not a garden and expected to thrive. Immediate ownership, high autonomy, and direct access to some of the most sophisticated AI teams on the planet.
A Seat at the Big Kids Table:
Collaborate with ML engineers, researchers, and AI leads from elite frontier labs. Your work will directly shape how next-gen models are trained and aligned.
No Off-the-Shelf Problems:
You'll tackle gnarly, unsolved challenges like evaluating PhD-level expert networks or automating assessments of LLM-generated content. If you're looking for boilerplate ML, this isn't it.
Continuous Learning:
You'll be in an environment where curiosity isn't just encouraged its required. We prize intellectual sharpness and a bias for execution over credentials.
Pay That Reflects Your Scar Tissue:
We're looking for people who've been through the LLM trenches and made it out smarter. You'll be compensated accordingly.
What Will You Do?
Build systems that align human feedback into training loops think RLHF, DPO, and methods not even named yet.
Design algorithms to automatically evaluate the quality of human feedback and data at scale.
Prototype tools to support expert labeling and assessment across domains like physics, math, linguistics, and more.
Develop automated systems to assess expert competency and route the right task to the right human (yes, kind of like dating apps, but for PhDs and LLMs).
Research and implement active learning strategies, adaptive sampling, and other methods to minimize human effort while maximizing model performance.
Publish in top-tier ML/AI conferences and build thought leadership in AI alignment and human-in-the-loop training.
Collaborate closely with top-tier customers (think: frontier labs and household tech names) to understand real-world model training needs and translate them into scalable systems.
What Will You Need?
Experience shipping significant projects in LLMs or adjacent areas pretraining, post-training, fine-tuning, evaluation, human alignment you've done it, and you've got the scars to prove it.
A proven ability to walk into complex ML problems and start delivering value fastideally in environments where startup chaos was a polite understatement.
Strong grounding in ML theory and applied research, ideally backed by a PhD or Masters in Computer Science, Machine Learning, or related field.
Fluency in Python and experience with deep learning frameworks like PyTorch, JAX, or TensorFlow.
A track record of publication in top-tier AI/ML conferences (NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, ACL, etc.) is a big plus.
High agency, high integrity, low ego.
Bonus: Experience in assessing domain expertise, automated evaluation, or optimization problems involving humans-in-the-loop.
Were building the next-gen infrastructure for how LLMs and other frontier models learn from humans. If you've lived through the messy parts of building with LLMs and came out with hard-earned insight, this is your chance to shape the future of AI at a foundational level. The work is hard. The problems are unsolved. The impact is enormous. Let's get to it.

Brief: Wiproâs Neural Intelligence Platform harnesses the power of automation and artificial intelligence

technologiesânatural language processing (NLP), cognitive, machine learning, and analytics. The platform

comprises three layers: a data engagement platform that can easily access and manage multiple structured and

unstructured data sources; an âintent assessment and reasoningâ engine that includes sentiment and predictive

analytics; and a deep machine learning engine that can sense, act, and learn over time. The project entailed

automating responses to user queries at the earliest. The Monster Bot using the power of Deep Machine Learning,

NLP to handle such queries. User can see the how their queries can be answered quickly like allL1 activities can be

eliminated.

Entity Extractor -> This involves text extraction and NLP for fetching out important information from the text like

dates, names, places, contact numbers etc. This involves Regex, Bluemix NLU apiâs and machine learning using

Tensor flow for further learning of new entities.

Classifier ->This involves the classifications of classes, training of dataset and predicting the output using the SKLearn

classifier (MNB, SVM, SGD as Classifier) and SGD for the optimization to map the user queries with the best

suited response and make the system efficient.

NER: A Deep Learning NER Model is trained to extract the entities from the text. Entities like Roles, Skills,

Organizations can be extracted from raw text. RNN(LSTM) Bidirectional model is trained for extracting such entities

using Keras TensorFlow framework.

Brief: Wiproâs Neural Intelligence Platform harnesses the power of automation and artificial intelligence

technologiesânatural language processing (NLP), cognitive, machine learning, and analytics. The platform

comprises three layers: a data engagement platform that can easily access and manage multiple structured and

unstructured data sources; an âintent assessment and reasoningâ engine that includes sentiment and predictive

analytics; and a deep machine learning engine that can sense, act, and learn over time. The project entailed

automating responses to user queries at the earliest. The Monster Bot using the power of Deep Machine Learning,

NLP to handle such queries. User can see the how their queries can be answered quickly like allL1 activities can be

eliminated.

Entity Extractor -> This involves text extraction and NLP for fetching out important information from the text like

dates, names, places, contact numbers etc. This involves Regex, Bluemix NLU apiâs and machine learning using

Tensor flow for further learning of new entities.

Classifier ->This involves the classifications of classes, training of dataset and predicting the output using the SKLearn

classifier (MNB, SVM, SGD as Classifier) and SGD for the optimization to map the user queries with the best

suited response and make the system efficient.

NER: A Deep Learning NER Model is trained to extract the entities from the text. Entities like Roles, Skills,

Organizations can be extracted from raw text. RNN(LSTM) Bidirectional model is trained for extracting such entities

        Description:
        Spiral is the first free and open-source, not-for-profit bitcoin organization within a major tech company. In this case, that company is Block, Inc.
Spiral contributes to bitcoin by writing code, supplying grants to open-source projects and individuals, educating, entertaining, and testing the limits of what a small team can do to impact the future of money. Although many see bitcoin only as digital gold, Spiral also envisions bitcoin living up to its potential as the global standard for peer-to-peer payments.
The Role
We’re looking to hire a third Bitcoin Wizard to join our team. This position is for a highly technical, forward-thinking engineer who is able to do deep bitcoin research and development.
Spiral’s Bitcoin Wizards are deeply familiar with the bitcoin protocol, including its history, nuances, and implementation. They study bleeding-edge technical bitcoin proposals and disseminate them to the Spiral team and broader developer community. Each Bitcoin Wizard specializes in a specific aspect of bitcoin technology related to security, decentralization, privacy, scaling, and expressivity. They drive projects stemming from their area of expertise.
Currently, one of our Bitcoin Wizards is focused on ways to improve L2 security and the UX of mempool policy. Our second Bitcoin Wizard is hyper-focused on privacy, research theories, and protocol designs related to decentralized CoinJoins and rust-payjoin.
Bitcoin Wizards have tremendous freedom to choose their areas of focus and should include these along with their application (some examples are listed at the end).
You Will
Propose protocol improvements or new, innovative ideas that benefit bitcoin
Continuously develop and execute a plan for a project proposed in your application
Apply novel cryptography, build prototypes, write production code, run tests, create simulations, and establish performance benchmarks
Recruit collaborators, co-authors, and peer feedback
Engage with the broader community and obtain developer consensus
Review bitcoin-dev and lightning-dev emails, delving forum, ""wizards"" IRC channel, Bitcoin Optech, relevant research papers, and R&D from other cryptocurrency projects
Lead a study club for Spiral employees who want to explore technical proposals and ideas related to bitcoin, such as covenants, scaling UTXO sharing, and privacy
Publish learnings for the benefit of the broader dev ecosystem
You Have
12+ years of professional experience
Deep technical understanding of bitcoin
Proven history of collaboration
A research and engineering mindset
Willingness to learn
Ability to thrive in ambiguous environments and be self-directed
An ego-free attitude and willingness to detach from a particular proposal if it is decided to be untenable
How to Apply
In addition to submitting an application via this page, shoot us an email with three project ideas you might want to work on along with supporting evidence that you’ll complete them: apply@spiral.xyz
Below are examples of innovative scaling, security, privacy, and expressivity projects that Spiral would find valuable from a Bitcoin Wizard. Again, we expect candidates to determine which projects they will work on, so this list is merely a tool to help them get a sense of what we’re looking for.
New methods to share UTXOs among users as trustlessly and efficiently as possible
Lightning efficiency innovation
Cross-input signature aggregation
BIP324
Mining pool decentralization
Threshold signatures for LN
Mempool/bitcoin p2p security for L2
Evaluation of bitcoin security tasks stemming from MEV, tokens, stablecoins, etc.
Applied ZKP for LN gossip to hide UTXO funding
Bitcoin script opcode innovation, tradeoff evaluation, and driving (CTV, CSFS, TLUV, CAT, OP_VAULT, etc.)
We’re working to build a more inclusive economy where our customers have equal access to opportunity, and we strive to live by these same values in building our workplace. Block is an equal opportunity employer evaluating all employees and job applicants without regard to identity or any legally protected class.

Project Description:

The objective is to implement a strategic technical solution to support the governance and monitoring of break standards - including enhancements to audit capabilities. As a part of this program, the required remediation of source system data feeds involves consolidation of data into standardized feeds.



These remediated data feeds will be consumed by ETL layer. The reconciliation tool is

What You'll Do
As a cryptography engineer, you will work closely on our ZKP and MPC proving stacks. You will implement core cryptographic primitives (SPDZ, Bulletproofs, ElGamal, etc.) and optimize them for low-latency execution. In addition, you will help with internal audits, ensuring that Renegade maintains consistent state while being as flexible and expressive as possible.You'd be a good fit if..
You have a background in pure math, cryptography, or security research.
Have familiarity with zero-knowledge proofs and multi-party computation, or can pick it up quickly.
Able to work with zero-knowledge cryptography libraries, including Arkworks, Circom, and Dalek.
Able to work with StarkNet and the Cairo language.

"Title: Full-Stack Engineer for IoT Security Platform
        Company: Cylera
        Location: US
        
        Description:
        What Cylera does
Cylera is a healthcare cybersecurity company that helps hospitals understand and manage their attack surface area. Our offering has three main use cases:
Identify the attack surface area
: assess where and how the enterprise network is likely to be attacked, by identifying assets and detecting risks.
Harden the attack surface area
: recommend preventative measures to reduce the opportunities for a malicious actor to breach the network, such as patching and segmentation.
Monitor the attack surface area
: real-time monitoring for exploitation attempts, including both proactive and reactive alerting.
Why it matters
In the last half decade or so, hospitals have increasingly adopted connected IoT devices to improve the quality and robustness of patient care. This has come with unintended consequences, primarily by increasing the attack surface area for malicious actors to take advantage of. Hospital IT staffs aren’t equipped to handle this problem with limited resources, leading to a trend of ransomware attacks that are increasing in frequency and effectiveness. Hospitals are aware of this gap and are eager to find a comprehensive solution that protects them.
What we do
We have a team of engineers that work across the full tech stack. Our responsibilities include, but are not limited to, real-time & batch processing in the cloud, building APIs, front-end development, and application support / monitoring. The languages we primarily work with are Python and Javascript. Our infrastructure is hosted in Google Cloud Platform, and we deploy primarily to Kubernetes, including components such as Kafka, Elasticsearch, PostgreSQL, Airflow, and Redis.
Requirements
What we’re looking for (technical)
We’re looking for an application developer to join our engineering team. This developer must be very strong with Python, as a majority of the work will be backend-focused.
Additional required skills:
Flask API framework
Competency and comfort with ReactJS.
Differentiating skills:
Experience building distributed microservice architectures
Experience building high-performance data pipelines
Familiarity working with large time-series datasets
TypeScript
TailwindCSS
What we’re looking for (soft skills)
We value the soft skills in an engineer as much as, if not more than, any technical skill. The must haves for a candidate include:
Strong communication skills:
Can you communicate complex technical concepts simply? Do you successfully resolve disagreements in a professional manner?
Passion and curiosity
: Are you hungry to contribute? Are you eager to tackle difficult problems? Do you enjoy learning from and teaching others?
Small ego:
Do you demonstrate respect for your peers? Would you be happy if you had to work with yourself?

Who Are We?
We're a fast-moving AI infrastructure company partnering with frontier labs and top-tier research organizations to deliver the high-quality, domain-specific training data that cutting-edge models depend on. Our platform and services are critical for teams working on advanced AI systems from LLMs to multimodal model and our mission is to push the frontier of what's possible with human-in-the-loop AI development.
Were not here to follow trends were here to set them. Think of us as the silent engine behind your favorite frontier AI breakthroughs. You may not know our name, but you've definitely seen our fingerprints on today's most advanced models.
What's In It for You?
Real Impact, Real Fast:
You'll be dropped straight into a jungle not a garden and expected to thrive. Immediate ownership, high autonomy, and direct access to some of the most sophisticated AI teams on the planet.
A Seat at the Big Kids Table:
Collaborate with ML engineers, researchers, and AI leads from elite frontier labs. Your work will directly shape how next-gen models are trained and aligned.
No Off-the-Shelf Problems:
You'll tackle gnarly, unsolved challenges like evaluating PhD-level expert networks or automating assessments of LLM-generated content. If you're looking for boilerplate ML, this isn't it.
Continuous Learning:
You'll be in an environment where curiosity isn't just encouraged its required. We prize intellectual sharpness and a bias for execution over credentials.
Pay That Reflects Your Scar Tissue:
We're looking for people who've been through the LLM trenches and made it out smarter. You'll be compensated accordingly.
What Will You Do?
Build systems that align human feedback into training loops think RLHF, DPO, and methods not even named yet.
Design algorithms to automatically evaluate the quality of human feedback and data at scale.
Prototype tools to support expert labeling and assessment across domains like physics, math, linguistics, and more.
Develop automated systems to assess expert competency and route the right task to the right human (yes, kind of like dating apps, but for PhDs and LLMs).
Research and implement active learning strategies, adaptive sampling, and other methods to minimize human effort while maximizing model performance.
Publish in top-tier ML/AI conferences and build thought leadership in AI alignment and human-in-the-loop training.
Collaborate closely with top-tier customers (think: frontier labs and household tech names) to understand real-world model training needs and translate them into scalable systems.
What Will You Need?
Experience shipping significant projects in LLMs or adjacent areas pretraining, post-training, fine-tuning, evaluation, human alignment you've done it, and you've got the scars to prove it.
A proven ability to walk into complex ML problems and start delivering value fastideally in environments where startup chaos was a polite understatement.
Strong grounding in ML theory and applied research, ideally backed by a PhD or Masters in Computer Science, Machine Learning, or related field.
Fluency in Python and experience with deep learning frameworks like PyTorch, JAX, or TensorFlow.
A track record of publication in top-tier AI/ML conferences (NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, ACL, etc.) is a big plus.
High agency, high integrity, low ego.
Bonus: Experience in assessing domain expertise, automated evaluation, or optimization problems involving humans-in-the-loop.
Were building the next-gen infrastructure for how LLMs and other frontier models learn from humans. If you've lived through the messy parts of building with LLMs and came out with hard-earned insight, this is your chance to shape the future of AI at a foundational level. The work is hard. The problems are unsolved. The impact is enormous. Let's get to it.

"Title: Full-Stack Engineer for IoT Security Platform
        Company: Cylera
        Location: US
        
        Description:
        What Cylera does
Cylera is a healthcare cybersecurity company that helps hospitals understand and manage their attack surface area. Our offering has three main use cases:
Identify the attack surface area
: assess where and how the enterprise network is likely to be attacked, by identifying assets and detecting risks.
Harden the attack surface area
: recommend preventative measures to reduce the opportunities for a malicious actor to breach the network, such as patching and segmentation.
Monitor the attack surface area
: real-time monitoring for exploitation attempts, including both proactive and reactive alerting.
Why it matters
In the last half decade or so, hospitals have increasingly adopted connected IoT devices to improve the quality and robustness of patient care. This has come with unintended consequences, primarily by increasing the attack surface area for malicious actors to take advantage of. Hospital IT staffs aren’t equipped to handle this problem with limited resources, leading to a trend of ransomware attacks that are increasing in frequency and effectiveness. Hospitals are aware of this gap and are eager to find a comprehensive solution that protects them.
What we do
We have a team of engineers that work across the full tech stack. Our responsibilities include, but are not limited to, real-time & batch processing in the cloud, building APIs, front-end development, and application support / monitoring. The languages we primarily work with are Python and Javascript. Our infrastructure is hosted in Google Cloud Platform, and we deploy primarily to Kubernetes, including components such as Kafka, Elasticsearch, PostgreSQL, Airflow, and Redis.
Requirements
What we’re looking for (technical)
We’re looking for an application developer to join our engineering team. This developer must be very strong with Python, as a majority of the work will be backend-focused.
Additional required skills:
Flask API framework
Competency and comfort with ReactJS.
Differentiating skills:
Experience building distributed microservice architectures
Experience building high-performance data pipelines
Familiarity working with large time-series datasets
TypeScript
TailwindCSS
What we’re looking for (soft skills)
We value the soft skills in an engineer as much as, if not more than, any technical skill. The must haves for a candidate include:
Strong communication skills:
Can you communicate complex technical concepts simply? Do you successfully resolve disagreements in a professional manner?
Passion and curiosity
: Are you hungry to contribute? Are you eager to tackle difficult problems? Do you enjoy learning from and teaching others?
Small ego:
Do you demonstrate respect for your peers? Would you be happy if you had to work with yourself?

        Location: San Francisco, California
        
        Description:
        Spiral is the first free and open-source, not-for-profit bitcoin organization within a major tech company. In this case, that company is Block, Inc.
Spiral contributes to bitcoin by writing code, supplying grants to open-source projects and individuals, educating, entertaining, and testing the limits of what a small team can do to impact the future of money. Although many see bitcoin only as digital gold, Spiral also envisions bitcoin living up to its potential as the global standard for peer-to-peer payments.
The Role
We’re looking to hire a third Bitcoin Wizard to join our team. This position is for a highly technical, forward-thinking engineer who is able to do deep bitcoin research and development.
Spiral’s Bitcoin Wizards are deeply familiar with the bitcoin protocol, including its history, nuances, and implementation. They study bleeding-edge technical bitcoin proposals and disseminate them to the Spiral team and broader developer community. Each Bitcoin Wizard specializes in a specific aspect of bitcoin technology related to security, decentralization, privacy, scaling, and expressivity. They drive projects stemming from their area of expertise.
Currently, one of our Bitcoin Wizards is focused on ways to improve L2 security and the UX of mempool policy. Our second Bitcoin Wizard is hyper-focused on privacy, research theories, and protocol designs related to decentralized CoinJoins and rust-payjoin.
Bitcoin Wizards have tremendous freedom to choose their areas of focus and should include these along with their application (some examples are listed at the end).
You Will
Propose protocol improvements or new, innovative ideas that benefit bitcoin
Continuously develop and execute a plan for a project proposed in your application
Apply novel cryptography, build prototypes, write production code, run tests, create simulations, and establish performance benchmarks
Recruit collaborators, co-authors, and peer feedback
Engage with the broader community and obtain developer consensus
Review bitcoin-dev and lightning-dev emails, delving forum, ""wizards"" IRC channel, Bitcoin Optech, relevant research papers, and R&D from other cryptocurrency projects
Lead a study club for Spiral employees who want to explore technical proposals and ideas related to bitcoin, such as covenants, scaling UTXO sharing, and privacy
Publish learnings for the benefit of the broader dev ecosystem
You Have
12+ years of professional experience
Deep technical understanding of bitcoin
Proven history of collaboration
A research and engineering mindset
Willingness to learn
Ability to thrive in ambiguous environments and be self-directed
An ego-free attitude and willingness to detach from a particular proposal if it is decided to be untenable
How to Apply
In addition to submitting an application via this page, shoot us an email with three project ideas you might want to work on along with supporting evidence that you’ll complete them: apply@spiral.xyz
Below are examples of innovative scaling, security, privacy, and expressivity projects that Spiral would find valuable from a Bitcoin Wizard. Again, we expect candidates to determine which projects they will work on, so this list is merely a tool to help them get a sense of what we’re looking for.
New methods to share UTXOs among users as trustlessly and efficiently as possible
Lightning efficiency innovation
Cross-input signature aggregation
BIP324
Mining pool decentralization
Threshold signatures for LN
Mempool/bitcoin p2p security for L2
Evaluation of bitcoin security tasks stemming from MEV, tokens, stablecoins, etc.
Applied ZKP for LN gossip to hide UTXO funding
Bitcoin script opcode innovation, tradeoff evaluation, and driving (CTV, CSFS, TLUV, CAT, OP_VAULT, etc.)
